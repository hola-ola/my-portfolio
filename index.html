      <p>
        Hi, my name is Aleksandra and I am looking to take my first steps as
        professional developer. I have been intesively learning front-end and
        back-end technologies for the past five months and I have launched two
        projects. My current stack consists of:
        <b
          >HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HandlebarsJs, ReactJs, ExpressJs,
          NodeJs, MongoDB, Mongoose and Axios. </b
        >I am also familair with SCRUM and Agile methodology.

        <br /><br />
        My previous experience includes online marketing, communication and
        support roles in various companies and startups. I often worked with
        <b>Slack, Asana and Jira.</b>

        <br /><br />
        My decision to become a professional techie comes from my love to build
        things and solve logical problems. That goes hand in hand with personal
        motivation to have a job that allows flexibility and enforces
        independency.
